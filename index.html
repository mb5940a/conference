		<p> The roles that emotion and mental health play in the design world are far greater than most people would credit them for. The state of mind that a designer operates in affects their work, whether it be an emotion or a more long-term condition.
<br>
<br>
Mental health influences many designers and their work, both publically and privately. In addition, designers often think about how they might design for people with different mental health conditions.
<br>
<br>
Bloom; is a conference held for designers and artists that explores how emotions & mental health influence the design community. Several keynote speakers, including Zoe Quinn, Jason Santa Maria, and Rebecca Solnit will share both
personal and professional testimonies on how mental health affects their own lives.
<br>
<br>
In addition, there will be several break-out sessions on topics that
include Emotion & Story-telling in Design, Mindfulness, Understanding Mental Health, and Creating Mental Health-Conscience Design.
